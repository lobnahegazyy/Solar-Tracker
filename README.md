The project integrates an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor for precise detection of ambient light intensity 
and servo motors, controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, to enable automatic adjustment of solar panels for 
optimal solar energy capture. The system's primary objective is to dynamically orient the solar panel towards 
the light source, ensuring maximal energy conversion efficiency.
Utilizing LDRs, the system accurately measures ambient light intensity levels, facilitating real-time feedback to 
the servo motors. These servo motors respond to the received signals by precisely rotating the solar panel either 
to the right or left, aligning it with the direction of the incoming light. This automated process ensures that the 
solar panel continuously tracks the sun's position throughout the day, optimizing its exposure and thus 
enhancing energy harvesting capabilities.
By leveraging the Arduino microcontroller's computational power and interfacing capabilities, the system 
orchestrates seamless coordination between the LDR sensors and servo motors. This intelligent control 
mechanism enables the solar panel to autonomously adapt to varying light conditions, maximizing energy 
output while minimizing manual intervention.
Furthermore, the integration of advanced sensor technology and precision motor control underscores the 
project's commitment to efficiency, sustainability, and renewable energy utilization. Through its innovative 
design and functionality, the system exemplifies the intersection of technology and environmental stewardship, 
offering a scalable solution for harnessing solar energy with unprecedented efficiency and reliability
